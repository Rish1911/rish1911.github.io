      <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">When we started talking, I found out that you were just like me, careless about so many things. During the internship time we used to sit on calls all day. I remember one time I had an error that nobody was able to solve for 2 hours, I was so frustrated, I dropped off from the meeting contacted you personally and within 5 minutes the issue got resolved lol. It was so stupid, I don't think you remember that but still it was really funny. Everytime we both solved our issues and bugs together, Copy pasted each other's code. But then you were shifted to another department -_-. But still your rona continued from another department as well. We stayed in touch throughout no matter what. And since I've met you the bond has got stronger than ever(I feel this way, don't know about you). We vibed and connected instantly like kitni baar mile hain. I was really hesitant meeting new people at that time(kind of introvert you know). I thought virtual and physical meeting mei farak hoga but I was wrong. We were so comfortable with each other h na? I haven't done something like this for anyone so pta ni tumhe kya lg rha hoga ki pagal wagal toh nhi h yeh. Don't judge me. Out of love and friendship kra bs nothing else. I just wanted to tell you how special you are and how much our friendship means to me. I hope yeh site and all don't make things awkward between us. I just wanted to give something to you. Bekaar conventional gifts toh sb dete hain(kapde, makeup blah blah). I thought thodha fayeda ho engineering ka, talent dikhau mai apna Lol!! Anyways, jokes apart, Got a little off topic. So Happy Birthday!! Sorry for the gift delay. But good things take time you know(Just Like our physical meeting :D)! Hope you had enjoyed your day to the fullest. And kahin b jao bhulna mt meko :( You won't get a person like me anywhere!! XDXD. Waiting for your reaction on this !!XD BYEBYE. ILOVEYOU2 :)</p>
